# TDES-Hash
The hash algorithm created by me , still working on it though.

By combining several cryptographic techniques, this algorithm ensures that messages are confidential, secure, and authentic.

Blocks of the message and the final hash value are encrypted using triple DES encryption.

In XOR, bits from different variables are combined to produce a new value.

Variables A, B, and C are created using MD5 and SHA hashes.

To increase the security of the final hash value, a 64-bit salt value is added.

To verify the authenticity of a message, a digital signature is appended.

As a result of this combination of techniques, the algorithm is secure and resistant to attacks.
